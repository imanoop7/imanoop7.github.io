[{"content":"Transformers from Scratch: Implementing Attention Is All You Need Transformers have transformed the field of sequence modeling by replacing recurrent nets with self-attention. I was curious about how exactly this works under the hood, so I dove into the “Attention Is All You Need” paper and tried building the components from scratch in PyTorch. In this post I share my understanding and some hands-on insights from that process. I’ll cover the motivation behind Transformers, break down the core ideas, and show PyTorch snippets for the key modules: scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, positional encoding, and an encoder layer. Along the way I’ll mention a few hiccups and “aha!” moments I had – hopefully to make this journey relatable to anyone else who’s wrapped their head around this for the first time.\nMotivation Before Transformers, sequence models like RNNs or LSTMs were the standard for tasks like machine translation or text modeling. These models process data step-by-step, which makes it hard to parallelize and can struggle with long-range dependencies. The Transformer architecture changes that by relying entirely on attention mechanisms, allowing information from all time steps to be used at once. I wanted to understand why this matters and how to implement it myself. Some motivations that stood out to me:\nParallelism and efficiency: Self-attention lets us process all tokens at once instead of sequentially, so training can be much faster on modern hardware. Long-range context: Every token can attend to any other token, so the model can capture relationships across long distances without vanishing gradients. Simplicity of components: Despite being powerful, the Transformer’s building blocks (attention, feed-forward layers, etc.) are relatively simple operations. This made me think it would be feasible to code and inspect them directly. Practical success: Many cutting-edge models (like BERT or GPT) are based on this, so learning it deeply feels like a useful investment. With those motivations in mind, I decided to implement the pieces myself. In the sections that follow, I’ll dive into each major concept. First I’ll list the core concepts at a high level, then explain them in more detail.\nCore Concepts The Transformer encoder is built from a few key ideas. At a high level, these include:\nScaled Dot-Product Attention: Computes attention scores between queries and keys, scales them, and uses softmax to weight values. Multi-Head Attention: Runs multiple attention “heads” in parallel so the model can jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces. Positional Encoding: Injects information about the positions of tokens, since attention alone is agnostic to sequence order. Feed-Forward Network: A simple two-layer MLP applied to each position separately and identically. Add \u0026amp; Norm (Residual Connections + Layer Normalization): Ensures stable training and easy gradient flow by adding skip connections and normalizing. Each of these will get its own discussion below. Together they form an encoder layer, and stacking several of those (typically 6 or 12 in practice) gives you a Transformer encoder.\nScaled Dot-Product Attention At the heart of a Transformer is the attention mechanism. Given a set of queries Q, keys K, and values V, scaled dot-product attention computes a weighted sum of the values, where weights come from the similarity of queries with keys. The “scaled” part means we divide by sqrt(d_k) to keep the values from blowing up when dimensions are large.\nimport torch import math def scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask=None): d_k = Q.size(-1) scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(d_k) if mask is not None: scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, float(\u0026#39;-inf\u0026#39;)) attn_weights = torch.softmax(scores, dim=-1) output = torch.matmul(attn_weights, V) return output, attn_weights ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/attention_transformer_blog/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"transformers-from-scratch-implementing-attention-is-all-you-need\"\u003eTransformers from Scratch: Implementing \u003cem\u003eAttention Is All You Need\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransformers have transformed the field of sequence modeling by replacing recurrent nets with self-attention.
